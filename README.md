The project is a protein search system which leverages the UniProt API to enable users to explore proteins.
It serves as a simplified and reimagined version of the official website, https://www.uniprot.org/. 
The website delivers a modern and responsive design, making protein exploration more accessible and intuitive.

* The frontend is built using React and the Ant Design library. It includes the user management table, toolbar, and
appropriate components for registration, authentication, and user interactions.
* The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, providing APIs for user registration, authentication, user data management (blocking, unblocking, and deletion),
and handling redirects for blocked/deleted users.
* MySQL is used as the database to store user data, including their credentials, status, and other relevant information.
